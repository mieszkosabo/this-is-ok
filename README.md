# this-is-ok

An ergonomic way to work with fallible operations in TypeScript.

### Why this library?

- ✨ Fully type-safe, and ergonomic API that uses popular conventions.
- 🎉 Comes with a clean and easy to use way to simulate the do-notation.
- ⚡️ Tree-shakable, works with esm, cjs, and doesn't force you to use `nodenext`/`node16` module resolution.

### Getting started

#### Installation

```bash
npm install this-is-ok

yarn add this-is-ok

pnpm add this-is-ok

```

#### Basic usage

TODO: add some basic usage examples here

#### do notation

TODO: add some do notation examples here

### TODO:

- [ ] (v1) fully tested
- [ ] (v1) fully documented (generate readme section from JSDoc)
- [ ] add function syntax and make them curried (e.g. `map(maybeNumber, x => x + 1)`) apart from method syntax (e.g. `maybeNumber.map(x => x + 1)`)
- [ ] add adapters for common built-in APIs such as `Map` of `fs` module.
